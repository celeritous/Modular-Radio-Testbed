The power supply is designed to be highly efficient and low EMI/RFI for the lowest possible noise contribution to the signal chain. 

The input can accept a wide input voltage range of 9-24VDC for power derived from a variety of sources including battery, 
vehicle, solar and other. 

In order to provide final RF powers of up to 20+ watts the high voltage rail provides 24-28V adjustable @ 4 Amps to power 
a high voltage final stage with lower current requirements. 

In order to provide the lowest noise power for the signal processing stages the low voltage rails provide 14, 6, 4.3 and 2.8 
volts intended for use with Low Drop-Out (LDO) Linear regulators at the point of regulation for minimum ripple and noise. The 
switching frequencies are interleaved for minimal ripple content and the switching frequency has been cchosen such that all 
primary integer harmonics are outside the HF Amatuer radio bands. The power supply switching frequency can optionally be driven 
with a spread spectrum clock to further reduce conducted and radiated harmonics. 

A complete range of diagnostics are also embedded in the power supply to monitor voltage, current and power good sensors on each 
voltage rail as well as the main input power. Key controller and switch temperatures are also monitored. The diagnostics are 
available through an on-board  ADC and controlled by an on-board I2C I/O expander.
