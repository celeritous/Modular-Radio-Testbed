The BP filter board provides 16 half-octave 7 pole Chebyshev bandpass filters from 100kHz to 60MHz excluding the AM 
Broadcast band.Each filter is switched by a fast SPDT bus switch on each end of the filer which terminates all unused 
filters.  All inductors are tunable so the filter shapes can be individually tuned and optimized. 

The BP FIlter board also incorporates a low noise pre-amp after the filter stage that can be switched in and out of circuit as well as a 
ditigallty programmed atenuator after the filter stage with a range of 0.5-31.5db that can also be switched in and out of circuit. 

Optional low noise bias circuits provide mid-rail bias of the bus switches.

Dual rf connectionsare provided for each input and output so signals may be monitored with the board in-circuit.
